          Hi there! My name is Alexander Wu. I'm an Amateur coder excited to
          learn web development and database management. Below you will find a
          list of my work as well as how to contact me for any inquiries. When
          I'm not coding, you can find me playing Team Fight Tactics, an
          auto-chess game, and board games!

<!-- tasks
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->
